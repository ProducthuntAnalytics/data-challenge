# Instructions

To get our graphs, it's pretty stupid easy. Just do the
following:

1.) Clone this repo

2.) In the root of the repo, create a `data` folder, and move your
CSV's here. They should be named `UsefulVotesData.csv` and
`userData.csv`

3.) Create a `graphs` folder in the root of the repo

3.) Run `graphGenerator.sh`
