# About Josh Kayani

Come Fall 2016, I'll be a **sophomore** at NC State University (the place you're sitting right now).

I'm working with [Dr. Kathryn Stolee](http://kstolee.github.io/) on the topic of code search -
the thing you do when you're stuck on a problem and look online for help.

More specifically, I'm writing a Chrome Extension (a thing that plugs into your web browser) to:
  * Log your searches (ooh, privacy issues!)
  * Survey you about your searches (were they useful or nah?)

Really, this project is meant to replicate a study that Dr. Stolee [conducted earlier](http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/43835.pdf) - the difference however, is that this study will look at developers and their search habits all over the web. The previous study looked at Google employees and their internal search tool.

Stuff I've done:
* Chrome Extension Development (hey, that's my research!)
* Java (for uni classes)
* And a bunch of other stuff you can find on my actual [site](http://joshkayani.me). Or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuakayani).

It may appear that I haven't done much, and that's pretty true. But I've only been in uni for a year, so..
