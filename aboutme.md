# About Josh Kayani

Come Fall 2016, I'll be a **sophomore** at NC State University.

I'm working with [Dr. Kathryn Stolee](http://kstolee.github.io/) on the topic of code search -
the thing you do when you're stuck on a problem and look online for help.

Stuff I've done:
* Chrome Extension Development (hey, that's my research!)
* Java (for uni classes)
* And a bunch of other stuff you can find on my actual [site](http://joshkayani.me).
